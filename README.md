# Internet-Service-Provider (backend-server)

This is the backend server for the Internet Service Provider.
This is developed by using node JS, Express JS, and MongoDB.
I also use some external libraries like cors as middleware and environment variables.

Here in this server, all the functionality is stored into MongoDB, and all the data is getting to the frontend are come from MongoDB.
